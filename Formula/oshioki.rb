  # The release tarball is already built: this formula only lays its files out
  # in the keg, so --build-from-source and a bottle pour install identical
  # bytes and there is no cargo build here to point at a prefix.
  #
  # From v0.1.8 onward the two Mach-O files in libexec carry
  # /opt/homebrew/opt/oshioki/libexec/<name> as their install name, set at
  # link time upstream (oshioki PR #89), so Homebrew's keg fixup finds nothing
  # to rewrite and the SHA256SUMS shipped beside them still verifies (oshioki
  # issue #87). Earlier tarballs, 0.1.7 included, do not: a bottle of one of
  # those still fails checksum verification whatever this formula says, so the
  # bottle has to be rebuilt from a release that includes that PR. A
  # non-default Homebrew prefix would need a tarball rebuilt with
  # OSHIOKI_PAM_INSTALL_NAME/OSHIOKI_PLUGIN_INSTALL_NAME set; only the default
  # arm64 prefix is supported here.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      The sudo plugin and hook state live outside the Cellar and need root.
      Run setup as yourself, not under sudo; it elevates once by itself and
      finds this keg's binaries, module and SHA256SUMS on its own:
        oshioki-laptop-setup
      Add --contextual-pam to authenticate sudo through PAM instead of the
      approval plugin. Keep a second root shell open while that runs.
      To drive the installer by hand instead, create /etc/oshioki/install.env
      (0600, root-owned;
      see https://github.com/epsalmond/oshioki/blob/main/RUNBOOK.md),
      then run:
        sudo HOOK_BIN=#{bin}/oshioki \\
          PLUGIN_BIN=#{libexec}/oshioki.dylib \\
          OSHIOKI_CHECKSUMS=#{libexec}/SHA256SUMS \\
          #{bin}/install-oshioki-hook --prelaunch \\
          --config-file /etc/oshioki/install.env
      Releases with phone setup include oshioki-server and oshioki-phone-setup.
      To enroll a phone, install nats-server and run as yourself:
        oshioki-phone-setup
        sudo oshioki enroll
      Setup prefers Tailscale Serve. An existing HTTPS server is also supported:
        oshioki-phone-setup --server-url https://sudo.example.com --nats-config /path/to/hook-nats.env
